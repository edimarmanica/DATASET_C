# DATASET_C

# 1. Motivation
This dataset is a real-world web page collection. We crawled all the pages of the official websites of the city council of the Brazilian State capitals, then we labelled each web page that describes a single council member (entity-pages). We used this dataset to evaluate different methods for entity-page discovery, i.e., methods that find the entity-pages of a particular type in the websites.

# 2. Observation
This dataset has 18 websites with entity-pages about council members. The official websites of the city council of the 26 Brazilian State capitals were analyzed. We excluded four websites because they did not have an entity-page for each council member, three websites because all the entity-pages were internal frames of a single page, and one website because it did not allow crawling its pages.

# 3. Contents of the Dataset
Currently the dataset involves:
a) Entity-type: council member
b) Websites: 18
c) Web pages: ??
d) Entity-pages: 558, each containing a single data record with detailed information of an entity of a particular type
